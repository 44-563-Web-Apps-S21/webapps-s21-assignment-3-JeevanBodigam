    <h5>Cooking:</h5>
    <p>Cooking is one of my favorite activity. As much as I’d like to think that all these lofty benefits were what
        first got me into cooking, really, it was the <b>praise</b>.</p>
    <p>Hearing the words ‘<b>this is amazing</b>’ was a huge
        motivator for me to keep spending time in the kitchen when I was learning to cook.Plus <b>it gives me an
            opportunity to nurture my family and friends</b>.
        To express my love and take care of them.The more I learn about nutrition the more I’ve come to realize that the
        most important factor for healthy eating is to
        avoid processed food and focus on using real ingredients.</p>

    <h2>PHP: A Scripting Language</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.php.net/">PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially
        suited to web development.
        Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.PHP
        code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common
        Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which
        may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP
        response.
