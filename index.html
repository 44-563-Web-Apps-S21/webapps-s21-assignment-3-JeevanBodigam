    <h5>Cooking:</h5>
    <p>Cooking is one of my favorite activity. As much as I’d like to think that all these lofty benefits were what
        first got me into cooking, really, it was the <b>praise</b>.</p>
    <p>Hearing the words ‘<b>this is amazing</b>’ was a huge
        motivator for me to keep spending time in the kitchen when I was learning to cook.Plus <b>it gives me an
        opportunity to nurture my family and friends</b>.
        To express my love and take care of them.The more I learn about nutrition the more I’ve come to realize that the
        most important factor for healthy eating is to
        avoid processed food and focus on using real ingredients.</p>
