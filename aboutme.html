    <p>Its the reponsibility of <b>The Punisher</b> to punish the evil minds around the world.Those who are potential
        threat to the common people.There is no exception for the people who believe gods in their world. </p>
    <p>Its been years more evil roots have been erupted in different worlds. All the super heroes may not come to rescue
        everytime those who didnt face them will face the Punisher!!!</p>
    <p>He is the one who deals after one is dead. He takes the person to his world. Its his rules and orders work there.
        Punishment is based on the crime and evil things he committed.</p>
